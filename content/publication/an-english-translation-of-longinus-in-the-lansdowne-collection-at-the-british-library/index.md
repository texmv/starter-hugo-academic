Scholarship has slowly come to recognise that the Greek treatise Περὶ ὕψους or *On the Sublime* ascribed to Longinus was more widely disseminated in the seventeenth century than was once thought. In this article I present a previously unstudied seventeenth-century English translation of Longinus, comprising approximately a quarter of the whole treatise, found in the Lansdowne collection of the British Library. After assessing the manuscript and its provenance, I attempt to determine the edition used for the translation, settling on the 1636 Oxford edition of Gerard Langbaine as the most likely candidate. I then consider the approach of the translator and, following some remarks on the date and authorship of the manuscript, provide a semi-diplomatic transcription of the text.
