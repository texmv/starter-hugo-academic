I﻿ am a scholar of early modern literary, cultural, and intellectual history with interests including Milton, Shakespeare, classical reception, Neo-Latin studies, the transnational republic of letters, the history of scholarship and education, orientalism, European-Islamic encounters, colonial America, and book history.

My first book, *Milton, Longinus, and the Sublime in the Seventeenth Century*, was published by Oxford University Press in December 2023. I am currently at work on a second book provisionally entitled *Polemical Erudition: Scholarship and Politics in the English Revolution* as well as several other projects, including a translation of Isaac Barrow's *De Religione Turcica*, a Latin poem on Islam composed during a visit to Istanbul in 1658*Life of William Cavendish* for the forthcoming *Complete Works of Margaret Cavendish*.
