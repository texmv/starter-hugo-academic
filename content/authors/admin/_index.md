A﻿ scholar of early modern literary, cultural, and intellectual history, I am an Assistant Professor of Humanities at the Hamilton Center for Classical and Civic Education, University of Florida. Prior to my arrival in Gainesville I held an Excellence Strategy Postdoctoral Fellowship at the University of Hamburg in Germany (2021–2024).

My first book, *Milton, Longinus, and the Sublime in the Seventeenth Century*, was published by Oxford University Press in December 2023, and I am currently completing two major projects: a second monograph entitled *Polemical Erudition: Scholarship and Politics in the English Revolution* and a translation of the Cambridge scholar (and tutor of Isaac Newton) Isaac Barrow's *De Religione Turcica*, a Latin poem on Islam composed during a visit to Istanbul in 1658. I have written over thirty peer-reviewed articles on topics across the range of my interests, which include Milton, Shakespeare, classical reception, Neo-Latin studies, the transnational republic of letters, the history of scholarship and education, orientalism, European-Islamic encounters, colonial America, and book history.
