As a scholar of early modern literary and intellectual culture I explore a wide range of topics in my work, from Shakespearean drama to Boylean science, but I am especially interested in the writings of John Milton, classical reception, Neo-Latin studies, the history of humanistic scholarship, the history of the book, orientalism, Anglo-Islamic encounters, and global early modern studies.

My first book, *Milton, Longinus, and the Sublime in the Seventeenth Century*, will be published by Oxford University Press in December and is now available for pre-order. I am currently at work on a second book entitled *Polemical Erudition: Scholarship and Politics in the English Revolution* as well as several other projects.
