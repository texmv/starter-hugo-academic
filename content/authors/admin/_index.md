A﻿ scholar of early modern literary, cultural, and intellectual history, I am an Assistant Professor of Humanities at the Hamilton Center for Classical and Civic Education, University of Florida. Prior to my arrival in Gainesville in August 2024 I held a three-year Excellence Strategy Postdoctoral Fellowship at the University of Hamburg in Germany.

My first book, *Milton, Longinus, and the Sublime in the Seventeenth Century*, was published by Oxford University Press in December 2023, and I am currently completing two major projects: a second monograph, *Polemical Erudition: Scholarship and Politics in the English Revolution*, which explores the relevance of humanist scholars and the European republic of letters to the political tumult of Britain in the 1640s and 1650s, and a translation of the Cambridge scholar (and tutor of Isaac Newton) Isaac Barrow's *De Religione Turcica*, a Latin poem on Islam composed during a visit to Istanbul in 1658. I am in the very early stages of developing my next book, provisionally entitled *Liberty to Know: Milton on the Freedom to Philosophize*, which will offer a comprehensive new study of Milton’s influential 1644 tract *Areopagitica* and the Anglo-American free speech tradition. I have written over thirty peer-reviewed articles on topics across the range of my interests, which include Milton, Shakespeare, classical reception, Neo-Latin studies, the transnational republic of letters, the history of scholarship and education, orientalism, European-Islamic encounters, colonial America, and book history.
