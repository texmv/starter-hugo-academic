As a scholar of early modern literary, cultural, and intellectual history I bring new light to the writings and thought of the long seventeenth century (c. 1550–1750) by providing new interpretations of familiar texts and by examining previously neglected or unstudied sources. My principal areas of research are early modern learned culture (encompassing such topics as classical reception, Neo-Latin, the history of scholarship, book history, libraries, universities, and the international republic of letters); orientalism and European-Islamic encounters; and Renaissance drama.

My first book, *Milton, Longinus, and the Sublime in the Seventeenth Century*, will be published by Oxford University Press in December and is now available for pre-order [here](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/milton-longinus-and-the-sublime-in-the-seventeenth-century-9780198875949?cc=gb&lang=en) (or [here](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/milton-longinus-and-the-sublime-in-the-seventeenth-century-9780198875949?prevNumResPerPage=20&prevSortField=1&sortField=8&resultsPerPage=20&start=0&lang=en&cc=us) in the US). I am currently at work on a second book provisionally entitled *Polemical Erudition: Scholarship and Politics in the English Revolution* as well as several other projects, including a translation of Isaac Barrow's *De Religione Turcica*, a Latin poem on Islam composed during a visit to Istanbul in 1658, and an edition of the *Life of William Cavendish* for the forthcoming *Complete Works of Margaret Cavendish*. I have published over twenty articles on subjects ranging from the influence of academic drama on Shakespeare's *Julius Caesar* to the circulation of a Latin treatise on Islam by the Polish-born Ottoman dragoman Ali Ufki. I was interviewed for the blog of the Royal Society about my discovery of several unnoticed letters by Robert Hooke and Isaac Newton at the Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin ([here](https://royalsociety.org/blog/2023/02/unnoticed-letters/)).
